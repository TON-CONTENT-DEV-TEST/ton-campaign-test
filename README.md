# TON Content Tech Web Dev Test

## Task

* Create a fully responsive campaign page.

### Nice to have

* Implement lazyloading to the images (ie http://appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload/).

### You might want to include

* Implement a flexible grid system.
* The fluid layouts should work for all devices.
* CSS should be compatible with all browsers.
* Performance of the page is important and should be optimised.

### Things to note

* We want to see your understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* Don't worry about the header/footer and the links.

The following are the wireframe previews of the mobile and desktop campaign page:
